# CS243 Project

This is the final project for EE243 Advanced Computer Vision, 2021 Spring, UC Riverside. This project is based on the implementation of D3Feat for CVPR'2020 Oral paper ["D3Feat: Joint Learning of Dense Detection and Description of 3D Local Features"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03164). Their original repository is [Here](https://github.com/XuyangBai/D3Feat.pytorch). If you find this project useful, please cite their paper:
